### Pressure Cooker Counter üç≤

This is a simple web app that counts the whistles of your pressure cooker.

### How It Works

The app uses your device's microphone to listen for loud sounds. When it hears a sound that is loud enough, it adds one to the counter. The app does not save any of your audio.

### How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Click the "Start Listening" button.
3.  Give the app permission to use your microphone.
4.  Put your phone or laptop near your pressure cooker. The counter will go up with each whistle.

### Privacy

This app is for you alone. It works completely in your web browser. No audio data is ever saved or sent anywhere.
